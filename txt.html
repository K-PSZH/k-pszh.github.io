<p>I've been familiar with the Danganronpa since <u>October 28, 2020</u>, when, on the advice of a friend (hi Rey), I watched Danganronpa the Animation. It was an unforgettable experience that I will remember forever. 5 hours, the whole series at once - that was my first anime ever. I fell in love with the characters, started diving into the primary sources... nothing could stop me. Games, manga, series, novels... And this god damn music. Japanese composers have always been masters of their craft. I was familiar with the Japanese style, thanks to the titans of Sonic the Hedgehog soundtrack - Jun Senoue and Tomoya Ohtani. But after getting to know DR, this style was crossed out for me, as I heard something new, something that was more to my liking. The music of the genius Masafumi Takada clearly reflected the state of affairs. No matter what - claustrophobia, flashback from childhood, sincere but short-lived happiness, crazy intentions, shocking views, tension during the discussion - all this was felt mainly in the music. Just imagine, how, looking at the character's sprite and simultaneously listening to any song from the game, you can come up with a lot of associations, and it's fascinating. My creative activity began on <u>April 12, 2021</u>, when I, inspired by the work of another remixer (hi Kidokat), opened FL Studio for the first time.</p>
